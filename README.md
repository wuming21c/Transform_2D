# repo purpose

Practice on 2D image transformation

# program function
Interactively create rectangles with customizable "pose" (2D transform)

# Method/Steps:
1. Open an empty window/"canvas"
2. Create a rectange with customized size
3. Select a deformation mode: translation, rigid, similarity, affine, or perspective.
4. Think about a way to "drag", to show different degree of transformation.

# Thought
OpenCV

Trackbar for enumerate and numeric options

# Note
Practice from Ex. 2.2, "Computer Vision: Algorithm and Appliations", Szeliski
